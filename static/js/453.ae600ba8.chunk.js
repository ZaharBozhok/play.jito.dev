The main problem with customizations is that we don\u2019t have any CSS selector to help us style the row. So we have to make it work in other ways.\\nWhat can we use? A background! Using a combination of colors, a repeating gradient and the right line height setting, we can get the effect of underlined lines. Take a look at an example like this:</p>\\n<iframe height=\\"300\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" title=\\"Textarea guide. 1\\" src=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/embed/oNpRxaJ?default-tab=html%2Cresult\\" frameborder=\\"no\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" allowtransparency=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n  See the Pen <a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/pen/oNpRxaJ\\">\\n  Textarea guide. 1</a> by JIeCoRyI3 (<a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3\\">@jiecoryi3</a>)\\n  on <a href=\\"https://codepen.io\\">CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n<p>Let\u2019s look at the example in more detail. As you can see, the basic idea is to use a gradient with a (line-height minus 1 px) step with the desired color. In the CSS rule background-image: linear-gradient(transparent, transparent 27px, black 0px); we can change the color of the underline by changing the color values (in this case black). We also forbid the user to resize and scroll the textarea. Why? Because then it breaks our customization :) The lines begin to overlap the text, and it looks bad.</p>\\n<p>If we need to add some paddings inside the textarea, then you\u2019ll also need to add background-position-y and move the lines by the right number of pixels.</p>\\n<p>How can we make this option more flexible? Let\u2019s look at the following.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"how-to-style-each-textarea-row\\">How to style each textarea row</h2>\\n<p>So, but the main question is, can we customize each row? The answer is yes! For this we need a little trickery and of course JS.\\nAs we remember from the previous example, the main problem with this approach was that we couldn\u2019t scroll or resize the textarea. Also, we never really customized the rows. In that case we do the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n  <li>We create a parent element. It will scroll when we change the size of the textarea. We also need the parent to complete the textarea with the customization block.</li>\\n  <li>Inside we\u2019ll have the textarea itself and a block to customize each row. Let\u2019s look at an example with characters in front of each line.</li>\\n  <li>We will then change the customization block when interacting with the textarea, which will give us the effect as if each string is customizable.</li>\\n</ul>\\nNow look at this example!\\n\\n<iframe scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" id=\\"player\\" src=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/embed/preview/KKZGmQL?default-tabs=css%2Cresult&amp;height=600&amp;host=https%3A%2F%2Fcodepen.io&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnerd-for-tech%2Fhow-to-customize-textarea-22958ec73928&amp;slug-hash=KKZGmQL\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\"></iframe>\\n\\n<p>Now I will explain how it works.</p>\\n<p>Our parent element essentially becomes a textarea. So we remove all stylization from the textarea itself. We also remove the scroll of the textarea itself and add it to the parent element. We can use focus-within to stylize the parent element when the textarea is in focus. The element I call \u201cdots\u201d here is our stylization element. The basic idea is that it has position: static and a big negative margin. Because of this, if it is positioned correctly when you scroll the entire parent element \u2014 the styling element will scroll along with the texarea! And this is what we wanted to achieve. To separate the lines in the stylization element, we use white-space: pre-line and the &#10; separator inside the element. In JS, we check oninput our textarea to see how much \\\\n the textarea value contains. We need the same amount in the stylization element-it\u2019s that simple! And it\u2019s very important that the line-height of the textarea and the stylization element are the same. Also, as you can see, we recalculate the height of the textarea itself. This is so that the textarea automatically expands to the height of its content, and the parent element can scroll accordingly thanks to overflow-y: scroll.</p>\\n<p>And inside JS we also change the internal line as needed when the textarea changes. In this case we use a <em>&#10;, that is, an asterisk (</em>) and a line separator (&#10;). However, we can replace this character with any other one! And we can customize it now separately from the textarea.\\nThus, we got a separate customization of the textarea rows without changing the textarea itself. This allows us the flexibility to change and style what we need. For example, here\u2019s how in this configuration we can make the lines from the first example:</p>\\n<iframe scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" id=\\"player\\" src=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/embed/preview/qBpGNjz?default-tabs=css%2Cresult&amp;height=600&amp;host=https%3A%2F%2Fcodepen.io&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnerd-for-tech%2Fhow-to-customize-textarea-22958ec73928&amp;slug-hash=qBpGNjz\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\"></iframe>\\n\\n<p>As you can see, we can now very flexibly customize the customization of textarea. So that our customization element doesn\u2019t get lost when scrolling, we need to remember to change its margin-top relative to the desired height.</p>\\n<p>That\u2019s all!

But many people don\u2019t fully understand how it works. Because of this, developers occasionally encounter problems, which are then difficult for them to solve. Let\u2019s dive deeper into this topic.</p>\\n<p>What is z-index in general? This is a CSS property that specifies the order in which the elements will be displayed when they overlap. Right? No, not really. In fact, the overlapping order depends on several parameters. Take a look at the following code example:</p>\\n<iframe height=\\"300\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" title=\\"Z-index guide\\" src=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/embed/ExXZovM?default-tab=html%2Cresult\\" frameborder=\\"no\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" allowtransparency=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n  See the Pen <a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/pen/ExXZovM\\">\\n  Z-index guide</a> by JIeCoRyI3 (<a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3\\">@jiecoryi3</a>)\\n  on <a href=\\"https://codepen.io\\">CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n<p>As you can see, the parent has position: relative. The child element has absolute positioning and a z-index, which is -1. But for some reason, the child element is still on top. Looking at the code again, you might notice a strange filter: blur(0px). I added this line for a reason :)</p>\\n<p>Let\u2019s see what happens if we remove this line:</p>\\n<iframe height=\\"300\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" title=\\"Guide to z-index\\" src=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/embed/LYLxemE?default-tab=html%2Cresult\\" frameborder=\\"no\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" allowtransparency=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n  See the Pen <a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/pen/LYLxemE\\">\\n  Guide to z-index</a> by JIeCoRyI3 (<a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3\\">@jiecoryi3</a>)\\n  on <a href=\\"https://codepen.io\\">CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n<p>But you may ask: What does the filter have to do with the z-index at all? The answer is the context.</p>\\n<p>The point is that the z-index works only within its context. What is a stacking context? It is an area along the spatial z-axis along which elements are lined up. And z-index will work within one such area. This means that it will not work in another!</p>\\n<p>Here is the definition from MDN:</p>\\n<p class=\'quote\'>The <strong>stacking context</strong> is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Okay, now we understand that z-index works only in contexts. But how are they created?\\nOne option is intuitively clear to all of us because everyone has used it:</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"positioning-other-than-static-and-z-index-other-than-auto\\">Positioning other than static and z-index other than auto</h2>\\n<iframe height=\\"300\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" title=\\"Guide to z-index\\" src=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/embed/ZEyLvgZ?default-tab=html%2Cresult\\" frameborder=\\"no\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" allowtransparency=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n  See the Pen <a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/pen/ZEyLvgZ\\">\\n  Guide to z-index</a> by JIeCoRyI3 (<a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3\\">@jiecoryi3</a>)\\n  on <a href=\\"https://codepen.io\\">CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n<p>The parent created a new context, which causes the child element to now use z-index: -1 in a different context. Therefore, the elements are simply displayed according to their order in the DOM. Before that, the parent did not create a new context and both elements used the context of the HTML tag.</p>\\n<p>But there are still many situations that create a new context. Let\u2019s break down each one so that you can quickly find the causes of problems in your layout in the future.</p>\\n<p>In all situations, the starting position will be the same: I will try to \u201cbreak\u201d the z-index logic of the child element by creating a new context on the parent.

I set the z-index to -1000000, but it didn\u2019t help :) It was the transparency of the parent.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"mix-blend-mode-other-than-normal\\">mix-blend-mode other than normal</h2>\\n<iframe height=\\"300\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" title=\\"Guide to z-index\\" src=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/embed/yLXgKga?default-tab=html%2Cresult\\" frameborder=\\"no\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" allowtransparency=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n  See the Pen <a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3/pen/yLXgKga\\">\\n  Guide to z-index</a> by JIeCoRyI3 (<a href=\\"https://codepen.io/jiecoryi3\\">@jiecoryi3</a>)\\n  on <a href=\\"https://codepen.io\\">CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n<p>Do you want to use blending?

But this is not the case. How we should develop our soft skills is very individual. Depending on the person, we must use different approaches and exercises. For example, people who are closed by nature, that is, introverts should put in more effort to develop their soft skills. Or rather, introverts, extroverts, and ambiverts should make efforts to improve various social skills.</p>\\n<p>Extroverts most often have problems with the ability to listen, to convey their point of view without unnecessary emotions. Ambiverts most often have problems with insecurity and fear of their objectivity. Introverts face an excessive lack of communication and limited contact.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"so-what-should-i-do\\">So, what should I do?</h2>\\n<p>Let\u2019s divide the practical tips for developing soft skills into three groups. determine which group you belong to. Then use the appropriate advice.</p>\\n<p>You can use <a href=\'https://ideas.ted.com/quiz-are-you-an-extrovert-introvert-or-ambivert/\'>this</a> resource to check your type of mentality. </p>\\n<h2 id=\\"extrovert\\">Extrovert</h2>\\n<p>First of all, you need to maintain your status as an outgoing and active person. Your horizons should be broad, but not deep. Read more books. If you, like me, are not very fond of books, read short articles or watch videos. Broaden your horizons and you can always support any conversation.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*1xNVnLKheACs9Lc19ZNx9g.jpeg\\" alt=\\"img1\\"></p>\\n<p>Also, learn to listen to the person. Try the following exercise. When you talk to someone, if you want to insert a line, catch yourself at such moments and do not hold back. Remember the question you wanted to ask and keep it in your head. Let the person get their point across. Let me tell you one secret \u2014 the most successful people listen, not speak.</p>\\n<p>Show interest in what the other person is saying. Ask more questions rather than complement his speech. The questions you ask should be open-ended. Do not disturb the person with your gestures, keep your hands below the eyes of the interlocutor. Do not be distracted unless the situation requires it (it is worth looking around when crossing the road, but do not look into the clouds while your colleague talks about how he spent his time on the weekend).</p>\\n<p>Smile. Seriously, a slight smile always makes a person more open to you. You should not approach a person with a wide back \u2014 this can put him in the position of a victim. Do not increase your size artificially, from the point of view of psychology, your colleague will perceive this as an attempt at domination.</p>\\n<p>And remember that an extrovert is already a sociable and energetic person by nature. Your task is to balance this. The extrovert listener is a great future leader. Such people can be inspiring while being a friend to you.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"ambiverts\\">Ambiverts</h2>\\n<p>Ambiverts are people floating. More often than not, this is the middle between extroverts and introverts. Sometimes they prefer to withdraw into themselves, and sometimes they radiate more energy from them than from a football fan. Your job will be to make those around you feel you. Impermanence can be frightening.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*9tRTVWVczG8Bi8Lv3kBtOA.jpeg\\" alt=\\"img2\\"></p>\\n<p>Try to create a consistent way of communicating with colleagues and friends. To do this, use a simple exercise \u2014 more practical. If there is an opportunity to go to the balcony during a break, go out, even if you do not smoke. If you are made an offer to go to a party, do not rush to immediately refuse because of insecurity or good manners. Give yourself a pause of 5 seconds, that\u2019s okay. Think before responding to different suggestions.</p>\\n<p>One thing that can help a lot to improve your soft skills if you are an ambivert is public speaking! Practice with your family or friends first. You can even try to visualize your presentation in your head while you commute to work on public transport. Then take the initiative. Your task is to learn to put yourself in unacceptable situations. This will help your social skills develop quickly. This way you can get a lot of experience.</p>\\n<p class=\'quote\'>You can also use the exercises that I recommend for both extroverts and introverts. In principle, all the tips in this article are not clearly directed. You can apply any of them.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\"introverts\\">Introverts</h2>\\n<p>To develop various soft skills, such as team management, empathy, the ability to resolve conflicts, you must be able to communicate with people. However, this does not mean that you should become everyone\u2019s friend. Try to perceive each person as a source of something interesting, as a valuable experience that you may never be able to get again.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*Xjvz4_Oe64zGjQpBVNuC0A.jpeg\\" alt=\\"img3\\"></p>\\n<p>One exercise I can recommend is to highlight a few positive traits in your coworker. Then, in your spare time, ask him about it. Nothing opens people up like asking about their interests or their good points. If you notice that a colleague has a very interesting hairstyle, mark it for yourself. Then ask which hairdresser he goes to.</p>\\n<p>Look at the behavior model of introverted people, who are famous at the same time and cannot do without the attention of society. Take a look at Keanu Reeves, one of the most popular introverts. A good lesson to learn from watching him is to be yourself. He is not afraid of himself and his simple image. Keanu can safely walk in the park and eat a hot dog next to you on the bench. But most importantly, he is the same in public.</p>\\n<p>A good exercise you can use is making faces in front of a mirror! Really, try it! At first, you will think that this is stupid. However, don\u2019t stop and keep making faces in the mirror. Thus, you get used to the unusual interlocutor. Also, you develop facial muscles, which indirectly affects your charisma, and therefore \u2014 communication with people.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"general-tips\\">General Tips</h2>\\n<p>Pay attention to your interlocutor. If you are communicating with a colleague and at this time someone is trying to interrupt or interrupt your conversation \u2014 do not let this happen. Say, \u201cNow I will finish with Dave and then we can deal with your question\u201d or \u201cMax tells me a very interesting thing, I would like to listen to him.\u201d This makes the person you are talking to feel valuable.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*6zz7gW6Yc2lviMPq5eUpFQ.jpeg\\" alt=\\"img4\\"></p>\\n<p>Don\u2019t speak negatively. Speak in a positive way. From a psychological point of view, if you initially assume rejection, you are more likely to be rejected. Instead of saying \u201cMary, are you busy right now?\u201d, It is better to use \u201cMary, can you help me please?\u201d</p>\\n<p>Let\u2019s understand the person with whom you are talking, that you listen to him and hear him. Nod your head, nod harder at statements that are especially true in your opinion. This way your colleague can understand that he is not talking to the wall.</p>\\n<p>Also, never allow yourself to make fun of others in a new team. However, you can joke about yourself. This will show you only the best side. In general, people who know how to joke about themselves are very respected in the team.</p>\\n<p>Name. When meeting a person, be sure to remember his name. In order not to forget it immediately, concentrate all your attention on this process. The first thing you should think about when meeting a new person is their name, not their clothes or appearance. To make it easier to remember the name \u2014 be sure to repeat it when you meet. These techniques help me a lot. As an example:</p>\\n<p>\u2014 Hi, my name is Kirill.</p>\\n<p>\u2014 Hey. and my name is Jame.</p>\\n<p>\u2014 Nice to meet you, Jame. Listen, Jame, what do you think about today\u2019s weather?</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"conclusion\\">Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Finally, I would like to share with you a couple of books that can help you.

Many of you have probably found various roadmaps over the Internet with an infinite number of different technologies to explore. First, young developer studies some of them. Then he visits interviews to find his first job. However, after he becomes a part of the team, it turns out that in the world of development exist not only you and a computer.</p>\\n<p>In any roadmap, you will never find even mentioning such things as soft skills. The description of various vacancies for beginner developers does not always indicate the requirement for any soft skills. Such misunderstandings often make developers confused. Why should one improve his soft skills? Is it that necessary in a workflow? Yes!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"what-exactly-are-soft-skills\\">What exactly are Soft skills?</h2>\\n<p>Soft skills are not only your ability to pass an interview and stay confident in stressful situations. Soft skills are also about:</p>\\n<h3 id=\\"ability-to-work-in-a-team\\">Ability to work in a team.</h3>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*ViW12Rh7q3OQ-Eu72eW03A.jpeg\\" alt=\\"img1\\"></p>\\n<p>You can often see such a point as \u201cability to work in a team\u201d in a description of vacancies, but what does it mean? This means that despite being an introvert, you should still communicate with many different people and stop staying within your own.</p>\\n<p>Let us imagine a common workflow scenario. At some point, you may face a problem that does not allow you to perform the task. The first thing you have to do is immediately inform your team about it. Trying to write your new library on the third day might be a bad idea because it takes more time and might cause future problems.</p>\\n<p>This trait means that you should find an approach to each person with whom you work. There are no bad people, but bad ways of communication. When I was in an internship in one rather large company, I had arguments with colleagues due to the difference in our hard skills. However, my mentor then told me one wise thing I still remember.\\n\u201cStop focusing on people\u2019s bad sides and try searching for good ones. Then try using their good sides to start building your communication\u201d.\\nI tried using this method and it helped me a lot. I hope it will work for you as well.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\"responsibility\\">Responsibility.</h3>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*tj8cODAFNxiK8ERGUwuVnw.jpeg\\" alt=\\"img2\\"></p>\\n<p>Do you think that working with someone, who is constantly late for meetings, is enjoyable? What about a person who takes on 20 tasks and cannot cope with them? Maybe a man who promised to help with a bug replenishment, but forgot about it? I do not think you do.</p>\\n<p>Now imagine that this person being you. What image of you will your colleagues make and what mental climate will you be forming? Forcing someone to worry not for his or her responsibilities does not facilitate working objectively and productively. Lack of responsibility is one of the reasons that lead to social regress.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\"sincerity\\">Sincerity.</h3>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*l3DHeuOWjfMNpPIKG3B2sg.jpeg\\" alt=\\"img3\\"></p>\\n<p>Seriously! Sincerity is something that can help you not only advance through the career ladder but also find new friends in life. Never deceive your colleagues and treat them respectfully. Find good traits in your colleagues` character and keep them in mind during the conversation. A fake smile has always been easily recognizable. Everyone wishes to have sincere people around, though this is not a trend in the 21st century.\\nTry being sincere and you notice how easier your communication with people around you might become.</p>\\n<p>Developing these basic concepts already takes a lot of time and effort. There are many other soft skills required for higher-level developers, starting from the Middle level, but I might talk about them another time.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"what-do-you-get-from-improving-your-soft-skills\\">What do you get from improving your soft skills?</h2>\\n<p>For some reason, this question is not obvious for many beginner developers. Soft skills allow you to advance as a specialist, communicate with colleagues just as you would with your friends, work with pleasure, and increase your productivity. At higher levels, you have to be able to train other people, lead them, and inspire them.\\nIn fact, progressing as a technical specialist includes developing your personality comprehensively.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"but-how-to-improve-your-soft-skills\\">But how to improve your soft skills?</h2>\\n<p>Read books! This is the easiest thing you can do. I would personally recommend a wonderful book to start with: Erich Fromm \u2014 \u201cThe Art of Loving\u201d.</p>\\n<p>Communicate with people more. Do not be ashamed to start a small talk with your friends, someone you are barely familiar with, or maybe even with people, you find extremely unpleasant. Pay attention to what they say and how they say it. By practicing more, you will get a valuable skill \u2014 you will learn how to listen and hear other people.</p>\\n<p>Never forget about getting a decent relaxation. It is very important to maintain the correct mental state. Any hobby will work, as long as you feel calm and steady doing it.</p>\\n<p>There is also good advice for getting in touch with your coworkers. At some point, eventually, you might need a helping hand from your colleague. There is no shame in asking for assistance, but you should know the right way to do it, so helping you was a pleasure and not torture. Never force someone to do something for you just because you think he should. Instead of \u201cJohn, you are my colleague and must help me with this!\u201d try to formulate it another way. For instance: \u201cJohn, I know how good you are in this, so I turned first of all to you, because no one will help me to figure it out better than you\u201d, sounds way more polite. It also explains that you asking John for help due to his skill and not due to his misfortune of being the nearest person to call for.</p>\\n<p>Next time I will cover other soft skills that are also worth your attention.</p>\\n<p>Major thanks to <a href=\'https://www.linkedin.com/in/danylo-havrylchenko-3ab06a146/\' alt=\'linkedIn link\'>Danylo Havrylchenko</a> for help in writing this article.</p>\\n","author":"Kirill Shelipov","category":"Business","title":"Why do you have to improve your soft skills?","previewImage":"https://i.ibb.co/nrH9Shb/soft-skills-why.png","description":"No matter if you are experienced or not in your field, soft skills are vital in all cases.

For example the <code class=\\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\\">long long</code> field should be aligned to a multiple of 8 and without second pad second element in array won\u2019t have a <code class=\\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\\">long long</code> field aligned to a multiple of 8.</p>\\n<p><b>Alignment of an array of <code class=\\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\\">struct A</code> objects</b></p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://zzck.dev/assets/images/2021-07-08-c++-struct-alignment/struct_A_arr.png\\" alt=\\"img2\\"></p>\\n<p>Thanks to padding <code class=\\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\\">long long</code> haven\u2019t lost its alignment.</p>\\n<p><b>Alignment of a <code class=\\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\\">struct B</code> object</b></p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://zzck.dev/assets/images/2021-07-08-c++-struct-alignment/struct_B.png\\" alt=\\"img3\\"></p>\\n<p>This is the same object, but due to alignment it will weight less than <code class=\\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\\">struct A</code> object. So different fields order will result to different memory object representation. This can lead to unobvious errors. For example to be as fast as possible you send a struct as a piece of memory over the network (ignore Endian problems \ud83d\ude04) and after a while occasionally (or intentionally) you change the order of fields and get corrupted values because now mapping is broken.</p>\\n<p><b>Alignment of an array of <code class=\\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\\">struct B</code> objects</b></p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://zzck.dev/assets/images/2021-07-08-c++-struct-alignment/struct_B_arr.png\\" alt=\\"img4\\"></p>\\n<p>P.S.
